# Final Project: The Robot in a maze

### Description of our project

Me and my classmate Afra Almazroui paired up for our final project in the Introduction to Interactive Media class. Our project was a robot that could be controlled from the laptop through Processing. We were able to achieve that by setting up an interface between Arduino and Processing and then from the Arduino connected to the computer, sending a radio signal to the Arduino machine controlling the robot. Thus, we built our robot with 2 nFR radios and 2 Arduino Uno microcontrollers. As a result, our robot was the type of robot that could be moved by the arrow keys on the computer and stopped by the space bar key. We also implemented a basic UI to display the controller on the canvas. 

### Major Problems

A major problem we encountered was a delay in the radio communication. After multiple attempts at debugging it, we decided to make it a 'feature' that makes it purposefully difficult to steer the robot. Furthermore, to add to the challenge, we have constructed a maze to navigate the robot through. 

Another problem we encountered was the wires getting loose from impact and movement. The loose wires were causing circuit problems and at times making our robot dysfunctional. We had not discovered this problem until much later in the production stage (1 day before the IM showcase), and the professor informed us that such a problem could have been avoided by soldering the circuit and removing the breadboard. However, due to the time restraint, we could not fix the issue. 

### Clever things about our project

I particularly enjoyed how we thought of the maze while trying to solve the delay. To me, it was a smart way of embracing the problem and turning it into a non-problem. As a result, people who interacted with our robot did not seem to be bothered by the delay but rather intrigued by it, and further motivated to get through the maze.

Additionally, I think how we used a bottle cap as a third wheel to support the weight of the whole robot in the front was really clever. The professor recommended this method to us during his office hours.
