# Final Project: The Robot in a maze

### Description of our project

Our project was a robot that could be controlled from the laptop through Processing. We were able to achieve that by setting up an interface between Arduino and Processing and then from the Arduino connected to the computer, sending a radio signal to the Arduino machine controlling the robot. Thus, we built our robot with 2 nFR radios and 2 Arduino Uno microcontrollers. As a result, our robot was the type of robot that could be moved by the arrow keys on the computer and stopped by the space bar key. We also implemented a basic UI to display the controller on the canvas. 

### Major Problems

A major problem was the delay in radio.
